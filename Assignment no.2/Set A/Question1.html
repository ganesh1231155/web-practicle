<br><br><b>Dussehra, also called Dasara or<br> Vijayadashami, in Hinduism, holiday marking the<br> triumph of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, over the 10-headed<br> demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama’s wife, Sita. The festival’s name is derived from the Sanskrit words dasha (“ten”)<br> and hara (“defeat”).Symbolizing the victory of good over evil, Dussehra is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Ashvina (September–October),<br> the seventh month of the Hindu calendar, with the appearance of the full moon, an event called the “bright fortnight” (shukla paksha).<br> Dussehra coincides with the culmination of the nine-day Navratri festival and with the tenth day of the Durga Puja festival.<br> For many, it marks the beginning of preparation for Diwali, which occurs 20 days after Dussehra.

Dussehra is celebrated with great fervour and fanfare.<br> In North India, it incorporates Ram Lila, a gala theatrical enactment of Rama’s life story.<br> Effigies of Ravana—often along with those of Meghnada (Ravana’s son) and Kumbhkarana (Ravana’s brother)—are stuffed with firecrackers and set ablaze at night in open fields</b>
<br><br><br><b style="font-size:30px;">WHAT DO PEOPLE DO :</b><br><i>Many people of the Hindu faith observe Dussehra through special prayer meetings and food offerings to the gods at home or in temples throughout India.<br>They also hold outdoor fairs (melas) and large parades with effigies of Ravana (a mythical king of ancient Sri Lanka).<br> The effigies are burnt on bonfires in the evening. Dussehra is the culmination of the Navaratri festival.<br>

There are many local celebrations in some areas in India that can last for up to 10 days.<br> ....Local events include:<br>

Performances of the Ramlila (a short version of the epic Ramayana) in Northern India.
A large festival and procession including the goddess Chamundeshwari on a throne mounted on elephants in the town of Mysore in the state of Karnataka.<br>
The blessing of household and work-related tools, such as books, computers, cooking pans and vehicles in the state of Karnataka.<br>
The preparation of special foods, including luchi (deep fried flat bread) and alur dom (deep fried spiced potato snacks), in Bengal.<br>
Many Hindus also believe that it is lucky to start a new venture, project or journey on Dussehra.<br> They may also exchange gifts of leaves from the Shami tree (Prosopis spicigera) as a symbol of the story of the Pandavas brothers' exile in the Mahabharata stories.</i><br><br><br><br></body>
